"(a) Local income taxes are excluded. Eleven states have county- or city-level income taxes; the average rates expressed as a percentage of AGI within each jurisdiction are: 0.10% in Alabama; 0.36% in Indiana; 0.11% in Iowa; 1.29% in Kentucky; 2.18% in Maryland; 0.17% in Michigan; 0.22% in Missouri; 1.47% in New York; 1.59% in Ohio; and 1.15% in Pennsylvania. Data are not available in Delaware, where Wilmington imposes a municipal income tax. In California, Colorado, Kansas, New Jersey, Oregon, and West Virginia, some jurisdictions have payroll taxes, flat-rate wage taxes, or interest and dividend income taxes. See Jared Walczak, “Local Income Taxes in 2019,” Tax Foundation, July 30, 2019, https://taxfoundation.org/local-income-taxes-2019/.   	",,,,,,,,,,,
(b) These states allow some or all of federal income tax paid to be deducted from state taxable income.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(c) For single taxpayers with AGI below $23,500, the standard deduction is $2,500. This standard deduction amount is reduced by $25 for every additional $500 of AGI, not to fall below $2,000. For Married Filing Joint (MFJ) taxpayers with AGI below $23,500, the standard deduction is $7,500. This standard deduction amount is reduced by $175 for every additional $500 of AGI, not to fall below $4,000. For all taxpayers with AGI of $20,000 or less and claiming a dependent, the dependent exemption is $1,000. This amount is reduced to $500 per dependent for taxpayers with AGI above $20,000 and equal to or less than $100,000. For taxpayers with more than $100,000 in AGI, the dependent exemption is $300 per dependent.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(d) Statutory rates and brackets for 2021 are shown. Brackets are adjusted annually for inflation, but 2021 inflation adjustments were not available as of publication, so inflation-adjusted amounts for tax year 2020 are shown.",,,,,,,,,,,
(e) Standard deduction and/or personal exemption is adjusted annually for inflation. Inflation-adjusted amounts for tax year 2021 are shown.,,,,,,,,,,,
(f) Arizona's standard deduction can be adjusted upward by an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount the taxpayer would have claimed in charitable deductions if the taxpayer had claimed itemized deductions.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(g) In lieu of a dependent exemption, Arizona offers a child tax credit of $100 per dependent under the age of 17 and $25 per dependent age 17 and older. The credit begins to phase out for taxpayers with federal adjusted gross income (FAGI) above $200,000 (single filers) or $400,000 (MFJ).",,,,,,,,,,,
"(h) Rates apply to individuals earning more than $79,300. Two special tax tables exist for low- and middle-income individuals: one for individuals with below $22,200 in income, and one for those with income greater than or equal to $22,200 but less than or equal to $79,300.",,,,,,,,,,,
(i) Standard deduction or personal exemption is structured as a tax credit.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(j) Connecticut and New York have ""tax benefit recapture,"" by which many high-income taxpayers pay their top tax rate on all income, not just on amounts above the benefit threshold.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(k) Bracket levels adjusted for inflation each year. Inflation-adjusted bracket widths for 2021 were not available as of publication, so table reflects 2020 inflation-adjusted bracket widths.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(l) Exemption credits phase out for single taxpayers by $6 for each $2,500 of federal AGI above $203,341 and for MFJ filers by $12 for each $2,500 of federal AGI above $406,687. The credit cannot be reduced to below zero.",,,,,,,,,,,
(m) Rates include the additional tax at the rate of 1 percent on taxable income in excess of $1 million.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(n) State provides a state-defined personal exemption amount for each exemption available and/or deductible under the Internal Revenue Code.
